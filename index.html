              <p>  <h3> Tajikistan </h3>  is a small Central Asian country located in the foothills of the Pamir Mountains. The true treasures of this nation are its natural attractions: the scorching Vakhsh Valley, the towering snow-capped peaks of Mount Evgenia Korzhenevskaya and Ismoil Somoni, the picturesque Pamir Highway that winds through bottomless gorges and high-altitude plateaus, stunning mountain lakes, and numerous national parks. <br>
          <br>
 
Tourists come to Tajikistan not only to conquer the grand peaks of the Pamirs. Here, they will find fascinating eco-routes through the country‚Äôs most beautiful landscapes, and the opportunity to experience the rich Tajik culture. Many traditions are still carefully preserved in families. Entire dynasties of craftsmen, embroiderers, and jewelers live in the ancient cities of Istaravshan, Kulob, and Khujand. <br> <br>

In the capital Dushanbe and in major tourist areas, comfortable hotels are ready to welcome guests. In more remote regions, travelers can stay in modest family-run guesthouses. Locals are hospitable and happy to meet foreigners who want to learn more about their homeland.</p>

    <p>  Bokhtar <br> 
Population ‚Äî 126,700 people (2022). Administrative center of Khatlon Region (viloyat). <br> <br>

According to one version, the city was founded in the 7th century, while other sources suggest a much later origin. According to legend, a local ruler issued a decree that every traveler passing through the city must bring a skullcap filled with soil. Over time, this formed a large mound, on which an observation post was built. The city was first mentioned in the 17th century, during a period when various local rulers governed the province under the suzerainty of the Uzbek dynasties of Bukhara. <br> <br>

Bokhtar became part of the Russian Empire between 1868 and 1870 after the conquest of the Kokand Khanate and the Emirate of Bukhara. Soviet power was established in the city in August 1922 following the defeat of organized Basmachi resistance. When the Soviet republics in Central Asia were formed, the city became part of the Turkestan ASSR (1924), from which the Tajik SSR separated in 1929. In the 1920s, Kurgan-Tyube became one of the centers of industrial development and cotton cultivation in the lower Vakhsh Valley. After Tajikistan gained independence, the city became one of the hotspots of the civil war (1992‚Äì1997). <br> <br>

In 2018, Kurgan-Tyube was renamed Bokhtar following a vote in the Parliament of Tajikistan.
